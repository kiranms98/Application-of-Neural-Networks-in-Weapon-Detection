# Application-of-Neural-Networks-in-Weapon-Detection

Using pre-existing CNN architecture such as ResNet152, YOLOv3 and MobileNet, this project deals with weapon object-detection. The custom-generated dataset of images contain a policeman and a criminal and one of 4 scenarios: either of the two is unarmed, both are armed or both unarmed. The models were evaluated on their ability to accurately classify an image into the appropriate scenario.
